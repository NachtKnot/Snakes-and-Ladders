# Snakes-and-Ladders
Extremely awful and painful to see code of a snakes and ladders mini-game written in Python

This was in fact my very first touch with Python and programming itself. I honestly don't understand how was I able to complete the project with literally zero programming knowledge (I wasn't even able to understand what a function was, and thought they were useless).

Nevertheless, I want to keep this disgusting code just to remind myself where I came from and how much I've improved since then.
